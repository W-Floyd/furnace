	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// renderCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	renderCmd.Flags().Bool("no-slave", false, "Do not run an internal slave instance")
	renderCmd.Flags().Bool("no-cache", false, "Do not run an internal cacher instance")
}
